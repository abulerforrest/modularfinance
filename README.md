# Modular Finance Case

This git repo is a case for Modular Finance, for showcasing coding skills. In this case I will be fetching data from their API and displaying it in a nice fasion.

#### Criterias

● A free text search field<br/>
● News item type<br/>
● Date range<br/>
● News items should have two view modes:<br/>

- List mode - a list of multiple news items (where filtering etc. takes place)

- Full/single mode - where a user can read a news item in its entirety

<b>Bonus:</b> Have some config setting or url param swap to another company

### Installing

In the project directory, you must first install the needed dependencies

### `npm i`

Then you open the app by running

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br/>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
